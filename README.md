R Package for Simulating Community Assembly and Ecological Diversification Using Ecospace Frameworks

ecospace is an R package that implements stochastic simulations of community assembly (ecological diversification) using customizable ecospace frameworks (functional trait spaces). Simulations model the 'neutral', 'redundancy',
'partitioning", and "expansion" models of Bush and Novack-Gottshall(2012). The package provides a wrapper to calculate common ecological disparity and functional ecology statistical dynamics as a function of species richness. Functions are written so they will work in a parallel-computing environment.

The package also contains a sample data set, functional traits for Late Ordovician (Type Cincinnatian) fossil species from the Kope and Waynesville formations.
